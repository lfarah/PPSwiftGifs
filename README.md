# PPSwiftGifs

PPSwiftGifs provides a convenient way to show animated GIF images as a part of iOS GUI.

## Installation

### Carthage
* `> Cartfile`
* `nano Cartfile`
* put `github "peterprokop/PPSwiftGifs"` into Cartfile
* Save it: `ctrl-x`, `y`, `enter`
* Run `carthage update`
* Copy `PPSwiftGifs.framework` from `Carthage/Build/iOS` to your project
* Make sure that `PPSwiftGifs` is added in `Embedded Binaries` section of your target (or else you will get `dyld library not loaded referenced from ... reason image not found` error)
* Add `import PPSwiftGifs` on top of your view controller's code

### Manual

* Just clone this repo and add ```PPSwiftGifs.swift``` to your project.
* Add ImageIO.framework to your project.
* Add ```#import <ImageIO/ImageIO.h>``` to bridging header.

## Requirements

Swift 1.2:
- iOS 7.0+ (iOS 8.0+ if you use Carthage)
- Xcode 6.3+

Swift 1.1:
Use [swift-1.1 branch](https://github.com/peterprokop/PPSwiftGifs/tree/swift-1.1)
- iOS 7.0+
- Xcode 6.1-6.2

## Usage

```
imageView.image = PPSwiftGifs.animatedImageWithGIFNamed("gif_name")
```

(File named "gif_name.gif" should be present in your project and copied as a bundle resource.
As far as I know, you can't add GIFs to asset catalogs.)
